# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Analysis Purpose
An analysis was performed to determine whether or not it would be a good business decision to expand the CitiBike customer base into Des Moines. Historical data for the 2019 August month in New York City was used as a basis for this analysis. Aspects such as population size, user's age demographic, and the average time spent commuting to and from work. 
### Results
The following description and summaries correspond to the slide title located within the story (found in the below link). 

"Population of Des Moines compared to NYC"

The population of Des Moines is significantly smaller than that of New York City which may impact the success of an expansion into this city. However, if assumed that the ratio of riders to residents, the potential customer base could increase by ~60,000. 

"Demand based on Age"

From historical data, it seems that the average birth year for the users ranges from 1983 to 1996 implying that using todays data (2020), the users that occupy the bikes most frequently are 24 to 37 years of age. Looking at the average age groups of Des Moines, you can see that there is a significant amount of younger which could result in a higher success rate of rider acquistions. 

"Average Commuting Time"

It is shown that the majority of rides range from 0-40 miuntes in duration. When comparing the mean travel time for NYC residents to Des Moines residents, it is observed that the average travel time is lower for Des Moines. This could imply that people don't live as far from work in Des Moines as they do in NYC, which could reveal an opportunity to increase rider usage relative to the baseline as people may be more inclined to bike to work as opposed to driving if the commuting time isn't as high to begin with.
